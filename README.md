## ❓ What is Tuxera NTFS for Mac?

Tuxera NTFS for Mac is a macOS system extension that provides full read and write access to NTFS-formatted drives. Unlike macOS’s built-in NTFS support, which only allows reading, Tuxera NTFS enables seamless file transfer, editing, and disk management on Windows-formatted volumes.

Ideal for users who frequently move files between Windows and Mac systems, Tuxera ensures high-speed data exchange without file corruption or permission errors. It includes smart caching, secure volume handling, and compatibility with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3).

Whether you're working with external hard drives, USB flash drives, or Boot Camp partitions, Tuxera NTFS ensures effortless cross-platform compatibility on macOS.
